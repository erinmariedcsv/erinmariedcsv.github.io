Hi! I’m Erin, a Research Assistant in the Department of Dermatology with a focus on microbiome-centered clinical research. I’m passionate about understanding how microbial communities influence our health and how evidence-based interventions can improve patient outcomes. My background spans microbiology, molecular biology, and nanotechnology. I currently support multi-site clinical studies involving postbiotic nutraceuticals and gastrointestinal health in individuals with diseases and disorders.
