Hi! I’m Erin, a Research Assistant in the Department of Dermatology with a focus on microbiome-centered clinical research. I’m passionate about understanding how microbial communities influence our health and how evidence-based interventions can improve patient outcomes. I currently support multi-site clinical studies involving pro- and postbiotic nutraceuticals and gastrointestinal health in both healthy and diseased populations..

My background spans microbiology, molecular biology, and nanotechnology. My path to microbiome science began with nanomedicine—developing image-guided medical devices at MD Anderson Cancer Center, where I worked on radiopaque nanoparticle-embedded polymers for interventional radiology. This foundation in translational research sparked my interest in how we can engineer solutions at the intersection of materials science and biology. I then transitioned to studying the oral and gut microbiome in cancer patients, investigating how microbial communities influence treatment side effects like oral mucositis in head and neck cancer. Our work with oral microbiome made me realize that the microbiome is not just a passive bystander, but an active contributor to clinical outcomes and can be modulated to improve patient experiences.

My primary career goal is to develop innovative therapeutic strategies and advance precision medicine by combining my nanomedicine background with microbiome science.
