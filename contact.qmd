## Research Interests & Collaboration

I enjoy interdisciplinary research environments, especially those focused on:

- **Microbiome-based interventions** in cancer and clinical populations
- **Clinical operations** and translational research coordination
- **Molecular data interpretation** including sequencing and omics analysis
- **Nanomedicine applications** in interventional radiology

Whether you're interested in discussing research ideas, exploring collaboration opportunities, or have questions about my work, I'd love to hear from you.
