Like many good discoveries, mine began as homework. Reading ["How to Be a Modern Scientist"](https://leanpub.com/modernscientist) by Dr. Jeffrey Leek challenged many assumptions I had about what it means to be a scientist—especially in today’s fast-paced, data-saturated world shaped by the internet.

The book brought to mind a previous experience when a post about genetically modified crops sparked a heated debate on social media. At first, participants exchanged thoughtful comments about food safety, sustainability, and agricultural ethics. But as opinions diverged, facts gave way to frustration. The focus shifted from evidence to identity, who was “for” or “against” the science, and revealing how quickly productive dialogue can unravel online. What began as an informative discussion among educated people soon devolved into personal attacks. Though I wasn’t directly involved, witnessing the exchange made me question my own willingness to engage publicly on complex topics. As scientists, we’re trained to critique ideas, not people, yet that principle often gets lost in the fast-moving rhythm of online discourse. For a while, the experience discouraged me from posting anything, whether personal or professional, on social media. Still, part of me knew that stepping back entirely wasn’t the answer and I have to maximize the benefits for science communication through the internet.

That is why I especially appreciated Dr. Leek’s guidance on responding to criticism. He encourages approaching feedback with curiosity rather than defensiveness—taking time to understand where criticism comes from instead of rushing to counter it. His perspective reframed communication for me: it’s not about winning an argument, but about fostering mutual understanding grounded in respect and evidence. The entire book served as a reminder of my responsibility to communicate science clearly and effectively, and in our digital age, that means engaging *thoughtfully* online, even when it feels uncomfortable.

Moving forward, I want to practice approaching difficult conversations about science with patience and openness. Every critique offers a chance to clarify, educate, or simply listen. In this time when trust in science feels very fragile, I believe how we respond may matter just as much as what we discover.
